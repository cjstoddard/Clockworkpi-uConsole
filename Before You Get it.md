# Things to do before you get your ClockworkPi uConsole

When you finally get your uConsole, the last thing you want to be doing is waiting another 3 days to get the other things you need for assembly. Here is a list of things to get and do in preperation for recieving your uConsole.

1. Buy batteries

Getting the right batteries is not that big of a deal, the batteries needed  are pretty easy to get. The problem of course is avoiding scam batteries. These are what I got, they work well and give me about 5 hours even with my CM4 overclocked.

2. Buy power supply

Like with batteries, these are cheap and easy to get, you just need to pay attention. Pretty much anything that provides 5 volts and 3 Amps and has a USB C connector will work.

3. Buy a large micro SD Card

The recommended 32 GB SD card is okay, but if you are going to keep music and videos on the device, you are going to start running out of space pretty quickly. Personally I think 128 GB is minimum for any computing device you use regularly. If you are going to be installing  Kiwix and using it for offline wikipedia, you will likely need a 256 GB SD card.

4. Watch a couple of Youtube videos on assembly

Putting the uConsole together is not paticularly hard, but it does help if you have seen it done.
